Have a dynamic background on the cards based on the type of pokemon - so take first type and change card background i.e water = blue, fire = red, grass = green, psychic = purple, normal = grey, flying = light blue, fighter = dark gray, ground and rock = brown etc.

Look into conflicting CSS styles giving us problems on the page - maybe html all in FOUNDATION and JS in BOOTSTRAP. Running issue with loading pokedex with bootstrap having the pokedex lettering and then what looks like FOUNDATION doing the video background. 

Possiblity add link to youtube/google search for the game that the pokemon first appear in.

Get youtube to dynamicaly build div container holding iframe so that it can load a max of 3 videos beneath the cards - maybe limit the number of pokemon cards to 6? and then have the bottom row get replaced by more searches.



***********
bug where you delete a pokemon card and then search another the deleted card shows back up - fixed
